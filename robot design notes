tried manually and then attached and coded
sailbot - one rod, no smooth progression. then we came up wth 2 rod attachment. 
coding it would fall to the other side. 
we retraced the steps in the code.not too close. we figured that out. it worked 

we started coding evrything individually. we timed it and it was 5 min. we decided to combine mission to save time. 
happy accidents - after the squid mission, the robot instead coming back it went forward and did the angular mission. 

reuse an attachment that we created later for earlier mission so that we will save time. 


we had a earlier prototype. Then we had the new robot , same idea but different design. 

initally the turns were accurate so we researched the turns accurate. then we found gyro. we researched about gyro. 
we used it to make the robot more accurate. It 


Gyro, sensor - code. 

Github - saved.. the code. access it from anywhere.
